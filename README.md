# Documentation
DriveAI is based in open source and aims to provide clear, concise, and useful documentation on our systems and procedures so that you can build your own self driving vehicle. This section of our git repository is dedicated to providing you with all the information we have learned from our trials and mistakes so far.

##Current Progress
###Vehicles
Our first vehicle, the (Cockroach) [Cockroach unified repo location], is complete in its current state. We have developed it to the full extent of its capabilities and are now ready to move on to our second vehicle.

Preliminary work has begun to procure our second vehicle, tentatively named the [Birdie] (https://github.com/DriveAI/birdie-planning).
