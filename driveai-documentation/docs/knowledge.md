# Introduction
This is where everything we know about self driving vehicles will be found. We're eager to have people join, learn from, and contribute to our project.

## What are they?

Autonomous vehicles (AV's), also known as self-driving cars, are vehicles that drive themselves. For now, the vehicles are generally required to be supervised by a driver, but the goal is for the cars to be able to drive themselves on their own.

## Why are they important?

Autonomous vehicles will have an impact similar to the internet in magnitude and nature. The internet allowed us to move information at a reduced cost and without human interaction. Autonomous vehicles will have the same effect on the transportation of physical goods.

More importantly, autonomous vehicles are going to save a tremendous amount of lives. Driver error is a leading cause of death, and self-driving vehicles will make the roads safer because they aren't prone to making the same types of errors.

## How do they work?

Autonomous vehicles use an array of sensors, including GPS, cameras, and radar, to gather information about the world around them (more about sensors [here](TODO)). Data from these sensors is then processed by state of the art algorithms to interpret the world in a meaningful way. They then use this interpretation to make fast and reliable decisions.

# Chapter 1: Levels of autonomy

According to the [National Highway Traffic Safetly Administration](http://www.nhtsa.gov/staticfiles/rulemaking/pdf/Automated_Vehicles_Policy.pdf), there are 5 levels of autonomy.

* *Level 0 - No Automation.* The driver is soley resposible for monitoring the roadway, and for safe operation of all vehicle controls.
* *Level 1 - Function-specific Automation.* The driver can choose to cede limited authoiry over a primary control (as in adaptive cruise control), the vehicle can automatically assume limmited authority over a primary control (as in electronic stability control), or the automated system can provide added control to aid the driver in certain normal driving or crash-imminent situations (e.g., dynamic brake support in emergencies).
* *Level 2 - Combined Function Automation.* The driver is still responsible for monitoring the roadway and safe opperation and is expected to be available for control at all times and on short notice. At level 2 in the specefic operation conditions for which the system is designed, an automated operating mode is enabled such that the driver is disengaged from physically operating the vehicle by having his or her hands off the steering wheel and foot off the pedal at the same time.
* *Level 3 - Limited Self-Driving Automation.* Vehicles at this level of automation enable the driver to cede full control of all safety-critical functions under certain traffic or environmental conditions and in those conditions to rely heavily on the vehicle to monitor for changes in those conditions requiring transition back to driver control. The driver is expected to be available for occasional control, but with sufficiently comfortable transition time. At level 3, the vehicle is designed so that the driver is not expected to constantly monitor the roadway while driving.
* *Level 4 - Full Self-Driving Automation.* The vehicle is designed to perform all safety-critical driving functions and monitor roadway conditions for an entire trip. The driver is not expected to be available for control at any time during the trip.
