# Technical Docs
This is where we document all of our previous work, current projects, and projections for the future. Here you will find detailed technical specifications for all of our past and current vehicles.
#Who We Are

We develop open source software for autonomous vehicles so anyone can build one. 

#Current Tasks
- Building out our knowledge base
- Building the [Birdie](/birdie/)
- Learning how to develop ROS Modules

## Getting Started
In order to get started, you'll need to become familiar with the following languages and services:

- *C/C++*, as all our production code is written in C/C++
- *Python*, for rapid prototyping
- *ROS*, which ties all of our systems together
- *Linux*, specifically Ubuntu, which is used by all of our members for developing software. Our production code runs on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- *Git*, knowledge of which is essential. We use GitHub to manage our codebase and keep everything up to date and organized. We look forward to your pull requests!

## The DriveAI Knowledge Base
Read through our knowledge base [**here**](/knowledge) to learn what we know so far! Getting up to speed on our current knowledge base is the fastest way to get to the front lines of development.

## Get Involved!
We use Slack as our primary communications interface. When you're comfortable with everything listed above and want to get involved with the team, send a message to [community@driveai.org](mailto:community@driveai.org) and someone will invite you to our Slack team. That's all there is to it!
