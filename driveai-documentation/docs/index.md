# AutoAI Technical Docs
This is where the engineers at AutoAI document all of our previous work, current projects, and projections for the future. Here you will find technical details for all of our past and current vehicles.

# Who We Are
AutoAI is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to the research and development of autonomous vehicles. We're a team of motivated engineers and students that are looking to bring the community together to understand and build autonomous vehicles. For more information, visit our [website](http://autoai.org/).

## Getting Started
If you're thinking about using our software to make your own autonomous vehicle, you'll find familiarity with the following languages and services to be helpful:

- *C/C++*, the programming languages that the majority of our production code is written in
- *Python*, a programming language that's great for rapid prototyping
- *ROS*, the framework that ties all of our systems together
- *Linux*, specifically Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, the operating system used by our developers and by our vehicles
- *Git*, a version contol solution

## The AutoAI Knowledge Base
Read through our knowledge base [**here**](/knowledge) to learn what we know so far! Getting up to speed on our current knowledge base is the fastest way to get to the front lines of development.

## Get Involved!
We use Slack as our primary communications interface. When you're comfortable with everything listed above and want to get involved with the team, send a message to [community@autoai.org](mailto:community@autoai.org) and someone will invite you to our Slack team. That's all there is to it!
