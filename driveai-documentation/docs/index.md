# DriveAI Technical Docs
This is where the engineers at DriveAI document all of our previous work, current projects, and projections for the future. Here you will find technical details for all of our past and current vehicles.

# Who We Are
DriveAI is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to the research and development of autonomous vehicles. We're a team of motivated engineers and students that are looking to bring the community together to understand and build autonomous vehicles. For more information, visit our [website](http://driveai.org/).

## Getting Started
If you're thinking about using our software to make your own autonomous vehicle, you'll find familiarity with the following languages and services to be helpful:

- *C/C++*, the programming languages that the majority of our production code is written in
- *Python*, a programming language that's great for rapid prototyping
- *ROS*, the framework that ties all of our systems together
- *Linux*, specifically Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, the operating system used by our developers and by our vehicles
- *Git*, a version contol solution

Read through our [knowledge base](/knowledge) to learn some vehicle autonomy basics. The knowledge base is written assuming no prior knowledge and is a fast we to get up to speed.

## Getting involved
We use Slack as our primary communications interface. When you're comfortable with everything listed above and want to get involved with the team, send us an email at [community@driveai.org](mailto:community@driveai.org) and someone will invite you to our Slack team. We look forward to having you in our discussions!
