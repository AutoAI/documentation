# Technical Docs
This is where we document all of our previous work, current projects, and projections for the future. Here you will find detailed technical specifications for all of our past and current vehicles.
#Who We Are

#Current Tasks
- Building out our knowledge base
- Building the [Birdie](docs.driveai.org/birdie/)

## Getting Started
In order to get started, you'll need to become familiar with the following languages and services:

- *C/C++* all our production code is written in C/C++
- *Python* for rapid prototyping
- *ROS* ties all of our systems together
- *Linux*, specifically Ubuntu, is used by all of our members for developing software. Our production code runs on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- *Git* knowledge is essential. We use GitHub to manage our codebase and keep everything up to date and organized. We look forward to your pull requests!

## [The DriveAI Knowledge Base](docs.driveai.org/knowledge)
Read through what we know so far! Getting up to speed on our current knowledge base is the fastest way to get to the front lines of development.

##Slack
We use Slack as our primary communications interface. When you're comfortable with everything listed above and want to get involved with the team, send a message to [community@driveai.org](mailto:community@driveai.org) and someone will invite you to our Slack team. That's all there is to it!
