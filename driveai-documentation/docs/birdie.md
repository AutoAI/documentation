#The Birdie
The Birdie is our second vehicle. It will be built starting in the Spring of 2016 by members of the AutoAI team.
#Introduction
After completing the Cockroach, we decided that our next vehicle should be larger and more robust to accomodate for our growing capabilities. The go kart frame has reached its maximum potential, and a new vehicle is in order that can expand to meet our needs is needed. Therefore, a street legal golf cart capable of speeds of 25mph with a range of at least 30 miles will be our next purchase.
We are currently in the process of researching different golf carts on the market with the intention to purchase one in the coming months. As soon as the vehicle is in our possession we will begin work on the autonomous drive system.
